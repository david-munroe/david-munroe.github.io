    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I believe that inside the black box is a system of tubes creating a siphon.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>When testing the black box, one test was met with no output of water. Most tests resulted in less water than was put in. There were a few trials where more came out then was input, but these were usually after a large pour. There was one test with a 500mL input and 1.9L output. Water had varying speed with which it was released from the box. The box made the same sound as a toilet tank filling following the first pour.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <p>The first test’s lack of an output was likely due to the immense amount of water required for the siphon to work. When we heard the sound that the box made, I figured that it came from an empty bucket filling. I placed a tube leading into the bucket which would be responsible for storing the water into the bucket. Another tube was pulled through a hole in the bucket and out the box.</p>
    <p>Certain tests resulting in less water is because they didn’t make it very far past the fill point of the siphon. This also explains why the larger input pours resulted in only slightly bigger outputs, because before each pour the tank got the chance to mostly empty itself. The output of 1.9L was preceded by a few tests with very little output, so both with the speed of the pour and the height of the water, an overflow to that extent was realized.</p>
    <p>Most of the other experiments I heard seemed to have pretty constant results, with slightly larger and slightly smaller outputs that wouldn’t account for the anomaly. In order to account for slight differences between input and output, as well as crazy overflows I can't think of alternatives.</p>
